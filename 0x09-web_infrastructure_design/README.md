# Web Infrastructure Design

## Tasks

- On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.

  - Requirements:
    - 1 server
    - 1 web server (Nginx)
    - 1 application server
    - 1 application files (your code base)
    - 1 database (MySQL)
    - 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8
  - You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
    - What is a server
    - What is the role of the domain name
    - What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
    - What is the role of the web server
    - What is the role of the application server
    - What is the role of the database
    - What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
  - You must be able to explain what are the issues with this infrastructure:
SPOF
  - Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
  - Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

- On a whiteboard, design a three servers web infrastructure that host the website www.foobar.com.
  - Requirements:
    - You must add:
    - 2 servers
    - 1 web server (Nginx)
    - 1 application server
    - 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
    - 1 application files (your code base)
    - 1 database (MySQL)
  - You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
    - For every additional element, why you are adding it
    - What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
    - Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
    - How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
    - What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
  - You must be able to explain what are the issues with this infrastructure:
    - Where are SPOF
    - Security issue (no firewall, no HTTPS)
    - No monitoring

- On a whiteboard, design a three servers web infrastructure that host the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic and be monitored.
  - Requirements:
    - 3 firewalls
    - 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
    - 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)
  - You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
    - For every additional element, why you are adding it
    - What are firewalls for
    - Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
    - What monitoring is used for
    - How is the monitoring tool collecting data
    - Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
  - You must be able to explain what are the issues with this infrastructure:
    - Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
    - Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
    - Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
